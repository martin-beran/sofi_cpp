 * \brief Program \c sofi_demo
 *
 * This is a simple demonstration and experimental program for the SOFI C++
 * library. It stores a persistent state of a SOFI system in a SQLite database.
 * The SOFI system is operated in several steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The database is initialized by <tt>sofi_demo init <em>file.db</em></tt>
 * <li>The database is populated with parts of a SOFI system: entities, access
 * controllers, integrity functions, etc. Any program can be used to manipulate
 * the database, for example, the standard command line client \c sqlite3.
 * <li>A list of intended SOFI operations is inserted into the database, using
 * any SQLite client program.
 * <li>The list of operations is executed by <tt>sofi_demo run
 * <em>file.db</em></tt>, which stores the results in the database.
 * <li>The results of operations can be examined by any SQLite client program.
 * </ol>
